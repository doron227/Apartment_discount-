## Description:

The aim of the Three python scripts is to alert the user about the existence of potential lotteres in the city that are of interest and at an appropriate price for the  user. Apartment at a discount (price per tenant) or  "Discount Apartment" is the flagship program initiated by the State of Israel with the goal of making it easier and accessible for homeless people to purchase their first apartment under preferential conditions. "Discount apartment" is a general term for the variety of housing programs within the Ministry of Construction & Housing and the Israel Lands Authority. It’s definition includes target price, reduced price, price for tenants and apartments for rent.

## The process includes several steps:

* Issuing a certificate of eligibility to participate in the program
*  Registration for lotteries
* The lottery
* Exceptions committee for winners (if necessary)
* Financing the apartment and getting a mortgage
* Choosing an apartment and signing a contract
* Waiting for the apartment to be occupied (the winners will be informed about the progress of the project)

## Why ?
The registration dates for the various projects are published in the press and on the Ministry of Construction & Housing’s website. After the publication of the dates, the lottery registration for said project opens for at least 8 days, and terms of the registry are published on the website. Participants holding a valid certificate of eligibility on the day of registration will be able to register for the project through the lottery registration website. The issue here is that the contestant has to enter the lottery either through the Ministry of Construction & Housing website or by staying up to date with the press for every lottery period. They would need to check which lotteries are held, in which cities and what the price per square meter in each lottery is. The contestant has to search  through a lot of information on the lotteries, most of which might not be relevant to his personal needs and can present two main problems: 
a) A huge time commitment and investment. 
b) The contestant may miss out on  relevant lottery opportunities. 



## Usage:
**When the user runs the code, a window will appear. In this window the user will be asked to fill in several details.**

**In addition** to the email which notifies on upcoming lotteries in a given city at a given price chosen by the user, the user will receive another email with a weekly update. This email officially updates on cities where the previous final price per square meter in the lottery is found to be lower than the average price per square meter in that city. In this list you can find 3-5 cities with the biggest discount.
