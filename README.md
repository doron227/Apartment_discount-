## Description:

Three Python scripts aim to alert the user about the existence of a lottery in the city that interests the user and at the appropriate price.
Apartment at a discount (price per tenant)
"Discount Apartment" is the flagship program initiated by the State of Israel with the aim of making it easier for the homeless to buy their first apartment under preferential conditions.
"Discount apartment" is a general name for the variety of housing programs of the Ministry of Construction and Housing and the Israel Lands Authority: target price, reduced price, price for tenants and apartment for rent.

## The process includes several steps:

* Issuing a certificate of eligibility to participate in the program
*  Registration for lotteries
* The lottery
* Exceptions committee for winners (if necessary)
* Financing the apartment and getting a mortgage
* Choosing an apartment and signing a contract
* Waiting for the apartment to be occupied (the winners will be informed about the progress of the project)

## Why ?

The registration dates for the various projects are published in the press and on the website of the Ministry of Construction and Housing. After the publication of the dates, the registration for the lottery for that project opens for at least 8 days, as will be published on the website. Those who hold a valid certificate of eligibility on the day of registration will be able to register for the project through the lottery registration website.
The problem that arises is that the contestant has to enter the website of the Ministry of Construction and Housing or follow the press every certain period and check which lotteries are held, in which cities and what is the price per square meter in each lottery - in fact, the contestant has to go through a lot of information related to lots of lotteries, most of which apparently do not suit his needs and this Creates 2 main problems:

A. It requires a lot of time and investment.
B. The contestant may miss out on many lotteries that suit their needs.

## Usage:

**When the user runs the code, a window will appear
In this window the user is asked to fill in several details.**
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/doron227/Dira-lottery-/blob/main/images/pic%2011.png" width="500" height="500" />

The user can enter up to 3 cities to which he wishes to receive an alert.
Each of these choices includes a city (blue rectangle) and a price per square meter that he is willing to pay in this city.
 
<p align="center">

The user has to enter an email - to which he will receive the notifications and the frequency of receiving the emails.
Also, the user has to choose when to stop receiving the emails automatically.

**In addition** to the email alerting the lotteries taking place in the cities and at the price chosen by the user, the user will receive another email with a weekly update - this email officially updates cities where the last price per square meter in the lottery is lower than the average price per square meter in that city.

 In this list will appear 3-5 cities where there was the biggest discount.
