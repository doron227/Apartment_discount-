## "Hamhir lemishtken"
"Hamhir lemishtken" is a method of selling land intended for the construction of apartments in Israel, and according to which entrepreneurs who wish to win a tender for development and construction in the land complex on which the residential apartments will be built compete for the final price of the apartment, which will be paid by the final buyer - the tenant. The winner of the tender is the one who offers the lowest final price for the apartment according to conditions established in the tender. For the purpose of publishing the tender, managing the process and selecting the winner, a dedicated project management was established, which oversees the contractor's compliance with its obligations to the Ministry of Housing and to the buyers of the apartments, including the prices of the apartments.
